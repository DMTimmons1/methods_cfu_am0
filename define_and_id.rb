# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:

# The include method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# include checks the string for the passeed argument "Hello"
# Since the argument "Hello" appears in the string, the return value is true.
"Hello World".include?("Hello")


"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")


"Hello World".end_with?("rld")

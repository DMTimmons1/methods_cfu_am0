# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
- I did not feel very confident going into this module, but after doing the exercises it began to make more sense. I just could not wrap my head around what the argument was until I did a few of the examples. Now I can say I confidently understand what the argument is.

1. How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
- I feel very confident in writing simple methods. The fact that Ruby allows you to create any amount of methods really makes me wonder how many possibilites there are when creating new methods. 

1.  What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
- Are there any any methods that apply to both integers and strings? If there are, can they be done in the same define or do they need to be separated into differnt defines?
